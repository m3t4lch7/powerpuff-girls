# The Powerpull Girls

This project is a demo of a TV series website.
It includes 3 basic pages - **Page not found** page, **show** page, with list of episodes and **episode** details page.
The state - shows & episodes are stored in Redux.

For the sake of simplicity of the setup of the project - I am pushing .env file, which normally I would not push :)

On my own server I used HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter, because of the server configuration.

## Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
